Model-based matching for causal inference in observational studies

Drawing causal inferences from nonexperimental data is difficult due to the presence of confounders, variables that affect both the selection into treatment groups and the outcome.  Matching methods can be used to subset the data to groups which are comparable with respect to important variables, but matching often fails to create sufficient balance between groups.  Model-based matching is a nonparametric method for matching which groups observations that would be alike if none had received the treatment.  We use model-based matching to conduct stratified permutation tests of association between the treatment and outcome, controlling for other variables.  Under standard assumptions from the causal inference literature, model-based matching can be used to estimate average treatment effects.
